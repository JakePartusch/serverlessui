# TODO

- Allow for "configure domain" command that deploys zone and certificate in a separate stack
  - Creates a config file in the root of the project with domain, zone id and certificate arn?
- Deploy lambda functions to the same API Gateway
- Allow for alias/buildId for predictable deploys
- Experiment with self-destructing stack
