# TODO

- npm install globally with an "alias"? Make sure the application.js file can still be referenced
- Allow for "configure domain" command that deploys zone and certificate in a separate stack
  - Creates a config file in the root of the project with domain, zone id and certificate arn?
- Publish packages for cli and cdk construct separately
- Deploy lambda functions to the same API Gateway
- --help doesn't do anything?
- Allow for alias/buildId for predictable deploys
- Experiment with self-destructing stack
